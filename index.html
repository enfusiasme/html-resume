            Started my employment 
            as a drink runner in the hotel lounge bar for 4 months, however I changed carrer
            path for the sommelier journey. After 6 months of hard working, I raised to the 
            position of a Senior Sommelier, with it carrying various responsibilities such as
            advising wines which pairs with food, handling difficult wine requests, organization
            and management of wine cellars, doing stocktake (both daily and monthly), placing

    <h2>Skills:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Hardwork and determination is one of the most important elements in my skillset, which were hardened 
            and cultivated from working different jobs during my years in highschool.
        </li>
        <li>Another skill which was created from picking up various jobs is goal-orientation. This skill not only
            motivated me throughout my highschool, but also deemed useful to keep a steady and clear visual on 
            important aspects of work when the pressure grew.
        </li>
        <li>Consequently, my pressure resilience and control under stressful circumstances only grew with each 
            time I worked a busy, nay chaotic service nights.
        </li>
        <li>Due to working in establishments in poor and harsh conditions, I build the skill of organization to its 
            fullest potential, both in a sense of self-organization and organizing the team and the work-load. 
        </li>
        <li>Nevertheless, I've been in managerial positions due to my refined leadership skills, which have been 
            nourished with the constant practice of engagement with the working team and keeping up the motivation 
            to put down the best effort into our work.
        </li>
        <li>
            I proudly consider myself a fast learner, therefore I had an amazing opportunity to learn and
            experience the operational aspect of the service industry, which in itself includes the fundamental use of
            finance and accounting, such as the calculating the daily revenue and supervising the deliveries.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Achievements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>WSET Level 2 in Wines</li>
        <li>STCW Elementary First Aid</li>
        <li>EMSA Health and Safety Certification</li>
