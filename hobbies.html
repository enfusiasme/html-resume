    <h1>Top 3 Hobbies of Mine</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>
        My passion for reading has been alive ever since I remeber picking up
        my first book. Ever since an early age, I've read book in genres ranging 
        from classic literature to fiction to mythology. Currently I mainly read 
        books on self-improvement and peotry, in order to continuously evolve and 
        grow both mentally, emotionally, spiritually and in knowledge and wisdom. 
        If i had to narrow down my favourite authors to two, I would have had to pick 
        Yuvel Noah Harrari and Robin Sharma.

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a strong believer of creativity, and the ability to express it in the most 
        unique and authentic way imaginable. For me, my creative outlet is to draw. Unfortunately,
        I might not so much time to invest into a drawing nowadays, but whenever I do, the end 
        result brings back the burning desire and admiration to life.

    <h2>Wine Tastings</h2>
    <p>
        Ever since I started working as a Sommelier, I have been exposed to the outstanding 
        world of wine, and I have been held captive in it ever since. My obsessive passion for 
        exploring different terriors and trying wines from all around the world brings joy and happiness
        that some might call it crazy. Therefore, whenever I have a chance and a free day, I always try
        visit a winery or a wine shop. In my weird way, it is as if you are travelling the world 
        from the comfort of a dark, cool cellar.
